1) Display of images with text should be in grids. 3 Columns & 4 rows. 
As mentioned in the Task, Pagination for all results could also be implemented (instead of hardcoded top12)
Below the image only title should be displayed.
Creation date, Description and all the details should be visible on hover over an image.

2) More unit tests for each scenario of flows for NasaController, NasaAppService, RequestCache.

3) Logger should be added to the Cache, to trace it's usage

*) Deletion of tabs not related to the task itself could be done (as counter or Clients), 
nerertheless I kept them, so the website would look as more complete as well as to quicker rely on working pieces of code.
